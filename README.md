# Transport

Transport is a Python package to simulate quantum transport of one-dimensional systems. The package can numerically solve quantum scattering problems at real or complex potentials for particles that impinge from either side (lead). The results are transmission and reflection amplitudes and scattering wave functions. 



## Installation

The package can be installed and updated via the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) with either of the following commands.

```shell
# install package
pip install git+https://github.com/samuehae/transport.git

# install package with additional dependencies for running examples
pip install git+https://github.com/samuehae/transport.git#egg=transport[examples]
```



## Examples

The usage of the package is demonstrated with the Python scripts included in the folder `examples`.
